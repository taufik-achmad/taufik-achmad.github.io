Introduction     This project is my attempt to solve the first case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Projects on Coursera that you can access here. I really enjoy working on this project because not like other data projects I have ever solved before. The challenge on this project is ranging from the size of the data provided, to the working on how to create a meaningful analysis to solve the main problem itself.</description>

      <description>Thank you to all the folks who have contributed both technical and creative skills to this project:
   Desir√©e De Leon ü¶í (designed 5 of the custom color themes, made illustrations for the workshop, and provided general aesthetic feedback along the way)
   Garrick Aden-Buie üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (debugged headroom.js and lent his panelset.js code to the theme)
   Allison Horst üêï (awesome illustrations of campfires, seedlings, and evergreens, as well as my R Markdown hedgehog mascot ü¶î)</description>
